This repository contains the R code (in Quarto format) needed to reproduce the findings of an analysis investigating the implications of the new 2025 ACC/AHA BP guidelines.
The code here reflects the content at the time of original submission; modifications may have been made during the peer review process by the time the paper is published.

Please note that, when attempting to reproduce this analysis, you will need to download the necessary NHANES datafiles from https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/default.aspx
Also, please note that you will need to change the names of the folders/directories so that R knows where to import the downloaded datasets from.

If you have any inquiries related to the statistical code, please do not hesitate to reach out at asu.ahmed.sayed@gmail.com
